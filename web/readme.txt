I have developed a project about coal miners in which the sensor I have used is MQ2, MQ3 ,MQ7 and DHT22 Sensors. In this project I have connected this sensors to ESP32 and the value of this sensors is sent to its local IP which I have designed using HTML,CSS and Javascript (mainly a Web Page) . Additionally , I have sent these data to thihngspeak.
