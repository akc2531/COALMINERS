**Local Website Display with ESP32**

This repository contains code and files designed for displaying a website on the local IP address of an ESP32 microcontroller. The project leverages the capabilities of the ESP32 to host a web server, allowing users to access a website directly from their local network. The website content is rendered using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it can be customized to suit various applications.

By accessing the ESP32's local IP address, users can interact with the website, view sensor data, control connected devices, or access real-time information, all from within the local network. This approach provides a convenient and responsive way to interface with the ESP32-based system.

The code and files provided here enable you to set up and deploy your custom website on an ESP32, making it accessible on your local network via a web browser. Whether you're building a home automation system, IoT project, or any application requiring web-based control, this repository can serve as a valuable resource for creating an intuitive user interface.

Please refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on configuring and deploying the website on your ESP32. Feel free to customize the website's content, style, and functionality to meet your specific project requirements.
